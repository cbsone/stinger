content_title: Build Stinger from Source

[[info | Building Stinger is for Advanced Developers]]
| If you are new to Stinger, it is recommended that you install the [Stinger Prebuilt Binaries](../00_install-prebuilt-binaries.md) instead of building from source.

Stinger can be built on several platforms using different build methods. Advanced users may opt to build Stinger using our shell scripts. Node operators or block producers who wish to deploy a public node, may prefer our manual build instructions.

* [Shell Scripts](01_shell-scripts/index.md) - Suitable for the majority of developers, these scripts build on Mac OS and many flavors of Linux.
* [Manual Build](02_manual-build/index.md) - Suitable for those platforms that may be hostile to the shell scripts or for operators who need more control over their builds.

[[info | Stinger Installation Recommended]]
| After building Stinger successfully, it is highly recommended to install the Stinger binaries from their default build directory. This copies the Stinger binaries to a central location, such as `/usr/local/bin`, or `~/eosio/x.y/bin`, where `x.y` is the Stinger release version.
