| Shell scripts automate the process of building, installing, testing, and uninstalling the Stinger software and dependencies.

To build Stinger from the source code using shell scripts, visit the sections below:

1. [Download Stinger Source](01_download-eosio-source.md)
2. [Build Stinger Binaries](02_build-eosio-binaries.md)
3. [Install Stinger Binaries](03_install-eosio-binaries.md)
4. [Test Stinger Binaries](04_test-eosio-binaries.md)
5. [Uninstall Stinger](05_uninstall-eosio.md)

[[info | Building Stinger is for Advanced Developers]]
| If you are new to Stinger, it is recommended that you install the [Stinger Prebuilt Binaries](../../00_install-prebuilt-binaries.md) instead of building from source.
